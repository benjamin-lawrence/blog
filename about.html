           About Me 
        </h1>
        <p class="me">“My name is Lucas Martin, and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience. 
            I have had a variety of customer service opportunities, through which I was able to have fewer returned products and increased repeat customers, when compared with co-workers. 
            I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player. Who could I speak with in your customer service department about your organization’s customer service needs?” (obviously not about me just wanted more content here)</p>
